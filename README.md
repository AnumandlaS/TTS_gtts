# Understanding how text to speech models are currently able to perform.
I have not used any text to speech models before, but before finetuning one I have to use one and know what are they capable of. So I used gtts as it is easy to use(and that was the first video I saw) and I realized it is not able to recognize some technical terms like API,etc.
